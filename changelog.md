###Changelog

2013-11-9 v1.1.0

- Re-written to only depend on Angular 1.2.0+. No More jQuery and no need for ngSanitize as $sce is inherantly included in the 1.2.0 version.
- Re-worked to be more angular-esq in it's initiation and use. Less reliance on global variables except for defaults and more use of bindings on attributes.
- Default styles are Bootstrap 3 classes, options to change these classes.
- Restructured the Toolbar to make it more plugin friendly, all tool buttons are encapsulated in their own scope that is a child of the individual textAngular bound scope.
- Added in ngModel support, this allows for validation in forms when the name attribute is used.
